1
00:00:29,641 --> 00:00:31,824
Ah, ah, what is it?

2
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:34,312
Did you come from the world of humans nya?

3
00:00:34,312 --> 00:00:36,740
Are you hungry?

4
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,140
This cat food,

5
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,124
You can have some!

6
00:00:39,124 --> 00:00:41,272
Even a little kindness is

7
00:00:41,272 --> 00:00:44,037
Somewhere's, someone's, second hand

8
00:00:44,037 --> 00:00:46,170
Formula of bad tastes

9
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,527
Applied to daily life

10
00:00:48,972 --> 00:00:55,981
The unspoken knowledge, nya nya nya nya

11
00:00:55,981 --> 00:00:58,173
Can be heard! Nya!

12
00:00:58,173 --> 00:01:00,606
What are you crying about nya?

13
00:01:00,606 --> 00:01:03,175
Why are you crying nya?

14
00:01:03,175 --> 00:01:05,569
I don't understand, I don't understand

15
00:01:05,569 --> 00:01:08,406
It's common sense in my world

16
00:01:08,406 --> 00:01:10,287
The kindness of not speaking frankly

17
00:01:10,287 --> 00:01:12,603
Is called "being an adult" or "hypocrisy"

18
00:01:12,603 --> 00:01:15,052
That is, that is,

19
00:01:15,052 --> 00:01:17,444
Common sense in the world of humans,

20
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:20,169
Right?

21
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:30,719
Heaven, and god, and fate

22
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:32,075
What about them nya

23
00:01:32,075 --> 00:01:36,636
I saw people with oblong eyes

24
00:01:36,636 --> 00:01:41,276
Good deeds and mischief are both, somewhere, someone's measure

25
00:01:41,276 --> 00:01:43,938
And after trying hard, one would thus receive rewards

26
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:45,675
And get punishment, right?

27
00:01:45,961 --> 00:01:48,640
What are you crying about nya?

28
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,169
Why are you crying nya?

29
00:01:51,169 --> 00:01:53,546
I don't understand, I don't understand

30
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:56,546
It's common sense in my world

31
00:01:56,565 --> 00:01:58,292
The blame of speaking frankly

32
00:01:58,292 --> 00:02:00,632
Has become taboo, and people deceive themselves about it

33
00:02:00,632 --> 00:02:02,908
That is, that is,

34
00:02:02,908 --> 00:02:05,717
Common sense in the world of humans,

35
00:02:05,717 --> 00:02:08,133
Right?

36
00:02:20,169 --> 00:02:24,774
Affection is also unspoken understanding

37
00:02:24,774 --> 00:02:29,334
Cruelty is also unspoken understanding

38
00:02:29,334 --> 00:02:33,416
If the world changes, we

39
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:39,080
Will be seen as weird, right perhaps?

40
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,703
But here, it is like this, so

41
00:02:43,703 --> 00:02:49,140
But here, it is like this, so...

42
00:02:50,548 --> 00:02:53,541
What are you crying about nya?

43
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,976
Why are you crying nya?

44
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:58,309
I don't understand, I don't understand

45
00:02:58,309 --> 00:03:00,777
It's common sense in my world

46
00:03:00,777 --> 00:03:02,940
Weren't you hungry?

47
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,468
Then until just a while ago, we were friends,

48
00:03:05,468 --> 00:03:07,803
We were, we were,

49
00:03:07,803 --> 00:03:11,682
But if this is burnt deliciously, ya

50
00:03:11,682 --> 00:03:14,318
Since, food

51
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:17,318
Since this is food
